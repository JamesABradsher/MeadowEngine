# MeadowEngine

2D Phyisics engine capable* of simulating dynamic motion as well as detecting and handling collision using sphere based and AABB based colliders.

My First proper foray into C++, developing this program has enhanced many skills I already developed from learning C and Java. It has pushed forward my understanding of concepts like pointers and memory management, project structure and build techniques, and greatened my understanding of the nuances of prgramming in the C++ Language.

\*some features are still in development

## TODO

* Implement Box Collider Detection
* Implement Momentum and Position solvers for collision
* Implement system for dynamically creating new objects
* Implement SDL2 Rendering Component
